# Assignment: Coin Tosses
# Write a function that simulates tossing a coin 5,000 times. Your function should print how many times the head/tail appears.

# Sample output should be like the following:

# Starting the program...
# Attempt #1: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 1 head(s) so far and 0 tail(s) so far
# Attempt #2: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 2 head(s) so far and 0 tail(s) so far
# Attempt #3: Throwing a coin... It's a tail! ... Got 2 head(s) so far and 1 tail(s) so far
# Attempt #4: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 3 head(s) so far and 1 tail(s) so far
# ...
# Attempt #5000: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 2412 head(s) so far and 2588 tail(s) so far
# Ending the program, thank you!
# Hint: Use the python built-in round function to convert that floating point number into an integer

# x = .23945593
# y = .798839238
# x_rounded = round(x)
# # x_rounded will be rounded down to 0
# y_rounded = round(y)
# # y_rounded will be rounded up to 1
import random

def toss(reps):
    # print new_toss
    attempt_count = 1
    head_count = 0
    tail_count = 0
    result = ""
    result_string_complete = ""

    for x in range(1, reps):
        new_toss = random.randint(0,1)
        if new_toss == 1:
            head_count += 1
            result = "head"
            print "Attempt #", attempt_count, ": Throwing a coin... It's a ", result, "! Got ", head_count, "head(s) so far and", tail_count, "tail(s) so far"
        else:
            tail_count += 1
            result = "tail"
            print "Attempt #", attempt_count, ": Throwing a coin... It's a ", result, "! Got ", head_count, "head(s) so far and", tail_count, "tail(s) so far"
        attempt_count += 1
