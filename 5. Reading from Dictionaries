# Assignment: Making and Reading from Dictionaries
# Create a dictionary containing some information about yourself. The keys should include name, age, country of birth, favorite language.

# Write a function that will print something like the following as it executes:

# My name is Anna
# My age is 101
# My country of birth is The United States
# My favorite language is Python
# There are two steps to this process, building a dictionary and then gathering all the data from it. Write a function that can take in and print out any dictionary keys and values.

# Note: The majority of data we will manipulate as web developers will be hashed in a dictionary using key-value pairs. Repeat this assignment a few times to really get the hang of unpacking dictionaries, as it's a very common requirement of any web application.
my_dict = {
    'name' : 'Anna',
    'age' : 101,
    'country' : "The United States",
    'language' : 'Python',
}

for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print "My", key, "is", value

#or#

def print_dictionary_values(dic):
    for some_key, some_value in dic.iteritems():
        print "My" + " " + some_key + " " + "is" + " " + str(some_value)
        
        # alternate method:
        # concatenating variables to strings commonly done with the .format() method (can be used on any string, or variable that
            # contains a string
        
        #print "My {} is {}".format(some_key, some_value)
