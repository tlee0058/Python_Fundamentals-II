# Assignment: Making Dictionaries
# Create a function that takes in two lists and creates a single dictionary. The first list contains keys and the second list contains the values. Assume the lists will be of equal length.

# Your first function will take in two lists containing some strings. Here are two example lists:

name = ["Anna", "Eli", "Pariece", "Brendan", "Amy", "Shane", "Oscar"]
favorite_animal = ["horse", "cat", "spider", "giraffe", "ticks", "dolphins", "llamas"]

def make_dict(list1, list2):
  
  zip_dict = zip(list1, list2)
  new_dict = dict(zip_dict)
  print new_dict

make_dict(name, favorite_animal)

#or#
def making_dictionaires(list1, list2):
    the_dict = {}
    for i in range(0, len(list1)):
        the_dict[list1[i]] = list2[i]
    return the_dict

# Hacker Challenge:
# If the lists are of unequal length, the longer list should be used for the keys, the shorter for the values.
