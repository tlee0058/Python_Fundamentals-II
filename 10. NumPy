Optional Assignment: NumPy
Build a simple program using the NumPy module.

You might have heard of NumPy. It's a library created for handling more complex mathematical functions. NumPy is often cited as being an important asset in any Data Scientist's toolkit and is widely used by scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and more.

Much like the module from the previous assignment, you'll want to install NumPy in a virtual environment. Find the instructions here.

Explore the library's documentation and give it a try starting with the Quickstart Guide.
